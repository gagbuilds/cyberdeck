## 11/1/2025 - rough schematics  

Decided to finally start working on the project after procrastinating for days, I noticed that there is only one month of blueprint left, hence i had to finish my deck quickly, so i started of by sketching my whole idea :)

## 11/2/2025 9:19 AM - Display troubles  

Effective displays land in two areas:

Raspberry Pi specific:
Low resolution (1040x600 or 1280x720) touch, sometimes still expensive
(sometimes) Non-touch laptop displays
Higher resolution no touch, more power draw
In this case, the choice I went with a 10.5 inch touchscreen display at the cost of ~$112 on ebay. It's 1920x1280, which is perfect for programming, given the extra vertical height.

I've been brainstorming the attachment mechanism between the main body and the controllers. Here's the plan. I'll have a ball bearing rectangle piece rotate to lock into the controller, which will have magnets. This piece will also have 3 wires routed on it. GND, 3.3v line, and a data line. These will be connected using spring loaded contacts to the wires. Since I'll have extra magnets, there's a good chance the end of the rotatable travel mode will have magnets to lock it into, as vice versa in the opposite mode. This day has been mostly just double checking all of the materials, and doing more indepth price checks  

## 11/2/2025 9:23 AM -  Ideas! Stenography, Shock Cages, and a beginning to the mod  

Coming back from a hardware hackathon, I have a couple of extra ideas.

Stenography typing at it's most basic level is typing chords. The left hand deals with beginning consonants, the thumbs vowels, and right hand ending consonants. To make it work, I would use the joysticks for the different thumb keys. This could be surprisingly effective, since the nature of capacitive keys allow predictive text. With it, I'm also considering adding a fifth capacitive sensor above the trigger module to allow for more streamlined typing

Inspired from this post https://community.element14.com/products/raspberry-pi/f/forum/8653/case-material-to-protect-raspberry-pi-3b-and-zero-in-hostile-environment

-Shock cages are not very common, but the nature of the cyberdeck revolves around portability. I'm designing it to survive drops that hit the handles, screen side, or back side of the deck. There are two parts to the shock absorption

-Springs: Designed for small drops <0.75m, I can calculate the stiffness required by doing some physics. The potential energy of the shock cage is calculated using weight and height, then I equal that to the elastic potential energy of the spring x4.

-Rubber Grommets: If a fall is greater than 0.75m, then the grommets will somewhat dampen the impact, if much less effectively.
